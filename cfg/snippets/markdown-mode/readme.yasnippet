### Downloading

$1 is hosted (and developed) on [Github][]. You can
[download the lastest snapshot][snapshot] or clone the entire
repository:

    $ git clone git://github.com/${4:killdream}/${5:${1:$(downcase text)}}.git

[Github]: https://github.com/$4/$5
[snapshot]: https://github.com/$4/$5/zipball/master


### The build system

#### Pre-requisites

$1 uses [Jakefiles][Jake] for build tasks. If you want them, you'll need:

* [UglifyJS][]     - the minifier tool;
* [Jake][]         - the build tool;
* [NodeJS][]       - for running the build tool;

**Note:**
> You'll need UglifyJS 1.0.2+, since the previous versions frowned upon
> form feeds. 


#### Listing the available tasks

To get a list of all available tasks:

    $ jake --tasks
    
To filter the task list, for example, to get all tasks that contain `foo`:

    $ jake --tasks foo
    
Or just the usual:    
    $ jake --tasks | grep foo


#### Building

To build both the distribution scripts and documentation:

    $ jake build
    
Individual things are placed inside the `build` namespace. You can just
`jake --tasks build` from the command line to get a list of them.

[Node.js]:  https://nodejs.org

### Documentation

You can build the actual documentation using:

    $ jake build:docs
    
Also, the source code should be pretty well documented using OrpheOS's
`calliope` documentation conventions. If you see functionality that miss
documentation on why it exists, the implications of using it, or that
just aren't explained well, please file a bug report :3
